**MuCeD: Multi-Class Celiac Disease Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 2475 images with 36510 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *epithelial nuclei* and *intraepithelial lymphocyte*.

Images in the MuCeD dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 1000 (40% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1620 images), *test* (495 images), and *val* (360 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 folds: ***fold 0*** (495 images), ***fold 1*** (495 images), ***fold 2*** (495 images), ***fold 3*** (495 images), and ***fold 4*** (495 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id***. The dataset was released in 2023 by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India.
